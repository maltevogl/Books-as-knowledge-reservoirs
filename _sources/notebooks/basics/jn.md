# Talking with Code

Using digital methods in humanties requieres researchers to keep track e.g. of the algorithms used to clean data or the queries to a SQL database. One way to make these parts of digital humanities research available to a general audience is an integrated approach to programming and documenting. This "literal programming" lies at the heart of Jupyter Notebooks, where the researcher can interactivley write code and documentation in a browser. 

This book is an example how this form of documentation can be extended to a fullfledged online publication.


## Jupyter Notebooks

  - Based on the notion of „literal programming“

    - Sourcecode, text, and outputs intertwined

# Overview 

The aim of this book is to understand basic DH technologies and their problems, while working with digital texts. For this aim, we will use modern text processing tools to build a _natural language processing_ (NLP) pipeline. The results from this pipeline will then be used to build a _multilayer network_ of occuring entities in the text, which then can be analyized by recent clustering algorithms.
    
  - Goal ðŸŽ‰  A commented script to understand and critically asses all steps to come from books to networks.

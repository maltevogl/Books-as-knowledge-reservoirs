    "# Using Spacy for POS tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Many NLP tools use machine learning in the backend. This is the case for NLTK and also for Grobid, the tool that converted OCR text to TEI. [Delft](https://github.com/kermitt2/delft) is the ml framework behind Grobid and it uses pre-trainend _word embeddings_ (later!) to create models for tagging and other tasks. Tagged data from external sources e.g. using the Doccano software, can be used to train a _Tucholsky tagger_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some ML basics\n",
    "\n",
    "For training a ml model, we need (large) datasets. Usually a dataset is split in 80/20 % sets, where 80%  are used for training and 20% for testing the resulting model. During this _\"learning\"_ procedure the f1 score is used to monitor progress. It describes the mean of precision and recall, where _precision_ is the number of correct positives vs all returned positives and _recall_ is the number of correct positives vs all possible correct positives. This is a similar concept as the so called _confusion matrix_. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Spacy ? \n",
    "\n",
    "[Spacy](https://spacy.io) is slighlty more modern than NLTK. It includes pre-trained models for other languages then english (e.g. [German](https://spacy.io/models/de)) and has lots of functionality to interlink with other Python AI software. Another nice thing are the in-build functions for visualization.What"
